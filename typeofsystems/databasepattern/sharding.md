# Sharding

Definition: Horizontal scaling method for databases.

Sharding enables scaling for both reads and writes when databases are too large for a single server.

Each shard contains a subset of data (e.g., users in the US stored on one shard, EU users stored on another), with shards residing on separate servers.
