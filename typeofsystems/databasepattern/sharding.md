# Sharding

- **Definition:** Horizontal scaling method for databases.
- Sharding enables scaling for both reads and writes when databases are too large for a single server.
- Each shard contains a subset of data (e.g., users in the US stored on one shard, EU users stored on another), with shards residing on separate servers.

### ➡️ Partitioning vs Sharding

| Aspect            | Partitioning                       | Sharding                              |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Data Location** | All partitions exist on one server | Each shard lives on a separate server |
| **Main Focus**    | Organizing the data                | Scaling across multiple machines      |
| **Data Split**    | Splitting data within a system     | Splitting data across systems         |
