# ⏺️ Partitioning

### ➡️ Purpose: Boosts performance by dividing a database into smaller, logical pieces (“partitions”).

- Data is split within the system, with all partitions typically residing on the same server.
- Partitions can be based on specific rules (e.g., user ID, date).

### ➡️ Partitioning vs Sharding

Aspect Partitioning Sharding
Data Location All partitions exist on one server Each shard lives on a separate server
Main Focus Organizing the data Scaling across multiple machines
Data Split Splitting data within a system Splitting data across systems
