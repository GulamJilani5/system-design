# ⏺️ Observability and Monitoring

### ➡️Three Pillar

##### 🟦 Metrics

- numeric time-series (throughput, latency, error rates, JVM memory, CPU). Good for dashboards and alerting.

##### 🟦 Logs

- structured event records (request errors, stack traces). Useful for forensic/debugging.

##### 🟦 Traces

- Distributed request traces across services (end-to-end latency, where time is spent).

### ➡️ Splunk

- **Splunk** = One platform that replaces ELK + Prometheus + Grafana + Jaeger.

### ➡️ Dynatrace

- **Dynatrace** = One managed platform that replaces Prometheus + Grafana + Jaeger + ELK + Alertmanager.
