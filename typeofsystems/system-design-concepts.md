## ➡️ Latency → Time taken to process a single request (in ms).

- Goal → minimize latency
- Caching
- Async Processing
- DB Indexing
- Parallel Processing instead of sequential
- Reduce network round trip (use batch request)

## ➡️ Throughput → no of requests successfully processed in a given time (in seconds).

- Goal → maximize throughput
- Horizontal or vertical scaling (↑ CPU capacity)
- Load balancer
- Optimize thread pool
- Async processing
- Optimize RAM
