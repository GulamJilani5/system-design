# ⏺️ Retry

## ➡️ Retry Logic

Determine when and how many times to retry an operation.

## ➡️ Backoff Strategy

- **Exponential Backoff**: e.g: 1, 2, 4 etc.

## ➡️ Circuit Breaker Integration

- Consider combining the retry pattern with the Circuit Breaker pattern.

## ➡️ Idempotent Operations

- Ensure that the retried operation is idempotent, meaning it produces the same result regardless of how many times it is invoked.
