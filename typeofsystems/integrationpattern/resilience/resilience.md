# Resilience

Resilience in the context of Spring Boot microservices refers to the ability of a distributed system to handle failures gracefully, prevent cascading errors, and maintain overall availability.

- Microservices architectures, by design, involve inter-service communication over networks, which introduces risks like network latency, service outages, or overloads.
- Spring Boot, combined with **Spring Cloud** and libraries like `Resilience4j` (the modern successor to **Netflix Hystrix**), provides built-in tools and patterns to build fault-tolerant applications.
