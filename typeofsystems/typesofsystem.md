# Scheduler Services

    These test your ability to manage delayed execution, retries, and time-based workflows reliably.

### 1. Design a Web Crawler

     → Handle crawl scheduling, politeness policies, and duplication filtering.
     → Talk about scalability via distributed workers and queueing.

### 2. Design a Distributed Task Scheduler

     → Support retries, job priorities, and delayed execution.
     → Think cron triggers, deduplication, and worker orchestration.

### 3. Design a Real-Time Notification System

     → Handle push delivery, user targeting, and token lifecycle.
     → Discuss delivery at scale, retries, and cross-device sync.

# Write-Heavy Systems

    These test your ability to ingest, process, and store large volumes of data efficiently.

### 4. Design a Rate Limiter

     → Choose between token bucket and leaky bucket models.
     → Discuss stateless vs stateful limits and distributed implementation using Redis.

### 5. Design a Log Ingestion System

     → Use Kafka (or similar) for high-throughput collection.
     → Highlight buffering, log processing, and downstream storage solutions.

### 6. Design a Collaborative Document Editor (Google Docs)

     → Handle real-time updates using CRDTs or OT algorithms.
     → Discuss synchronization, conflict resolution, and concurrent edits.

### 7. Design a Voting or Polling System → Emphasize idempotency and fraud prevention.

     → Handle real-time vs batch aggregation and analytics.

# Strong Consistency Systems

    Here, correctness trumps speed - you're expected to manage transactions, concurrency, and fault tolerance.

### 8. Design an Online Ticket Booking System

    → Talk about seat reservation and conflict resolution (locks, OCC).
    → Walk through atomic operations between booking and payment.

### 9. Design an E-Commerce Checkout Flow

    → Handle inventory consistency, cart state, and payment processing.
    → Include order tracking, retries, and failure recovery.

### 10. Design an Online Messaging App (WhatsApp/ Slack)

    → Cover message delivery guarantees and ordering.
    → Dive into message queues, acknowledgements, and offline storage.

### 11. Design a Task Management Tool (Trello/Asana)

    → Think CRUD APIs, user roles, and real-time collaboration.
    → Discuss background jobs, notifications, and state transitions.

# Read-Heavy Systems

    These are all about serving data fast and at scale - caching, repli…

### 13. Design a Content Delivery Platform (YouTube/Netflix)

     → Touch on video storage, CDN architecture, and latency reduction.
     → Consider user-specific recommendations and metadata indexing.

### 14. Design a Social Network Feed (Facebook/ Instagram)

     → Dive into fanout strategies and feed generation (Push vs Pull).
     → Talk about timeline ranking, pagination, and denormalized DB design.

### 15. Design a Product Catalog (eCommerce)

     → Cover search indexing, filters, and faceted navigation.
     → Focus on read-optimized DB design and availability under load.
