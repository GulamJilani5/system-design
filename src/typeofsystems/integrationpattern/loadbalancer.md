# Two Main Category Of Load Balancer
 ### ➡️1. Deployment Location = Internal or External
    → Focused on where the load balancer operates in your network.

   ##### External Load Balancer
     •Placed in front of the API Gateway or microservices directly.
     •Distributes incoming client traffic across multiple instances of the API Gateway or frontend service.
     •Common tools: AWS ELB/ALB, NGINX, HAProxy, Cloud Load Balancers.
   **Flow:** Client ──► Load Balancer ──► API Gateway ──► Microservices.

   ##### Internal Load Balancer
    •Used when one microservice calls another.
    •Distributes traffic across multiple instances of a target service.
   **Flow:** Service A ──► Internal Load Balancer ──► Service B (multiple instances)

| **Type**                   | **Description**                                                           | **Use Case**                                            | **Decision Made By**                          | **Tools/Examples**                                                                |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **External Load Balancer** | Load balancer exposed to the **outside world** (Internet)                 | Route incoming user traffic to backend services or APIs | Load balancer (centralized)                   | AWS ALB/ELB (public), Cloudflare, Azure Front Door, API Gateway                   |
| **Internal Load Balancer** | Load balancer used **within private network** (VPC, data center, cluster) | Route traffic **between microservices** (internal-only) | Load balancer, sidecar proxy, or client logic | AWS NLB (internal), NGINX (inside VPC), Istio (Envoy), Ribbon, Kubernetes Service |


 ### ➡️ 2. Routing Mechanism = Who decides where traffic goes
    → Focused on how traffic routing decisions are made.

 ##### Client-side Load Balancer
        →The client looks up service instances from service discovery
        →It then chooses which instance to send the request to
        →No central load balancer in between

   **📦 Examples:**
            •Netflix Ribbon + Eureka
            •gRPC with round-robin logic
            •Spring Cloud LoadBalancer

   **🔍 Used When:**
            •You want lightweight, decentralized balancing.
            •You control the client-side logic.
            •No need for complex routing or observability.

  ##### Server-side Load Balancer
        →A reverse proxy or gateway sits between the client and services.
        →The proxy/load balancer decides which instance to route to.
        →Clients only see the load balancer, not the actual services.

   **📦 Examples:**
         NGINX, HAProxy, AWS ELB/ALB, Kubernetes Services, API Gateway

   **🔍 Used When:**
        •Centralized control of traffic.
        •Front-door to external traffic.
        •Load balancing + TLS termination, rate limiting, etc.

  ##### Service Mesh Load Balancer
     →Each service has a sidecar proxy (like Envoy) next to it.
     →Requests are routed via these sidecars, which also handle:
        •Load balancing
        •Retries, timeouts
        •Circuit breaking
        •Security (mTLS)
        •Observability (metrics/traces)
    
   **📦 Examples:**
        •Istio (Envoy sidecar)
        •Linkerd, Consul Connect

 🔍 **Used When:**
        •You need full control, reliability, and observability for internal communication
        •You want to separate business logic from networking logic
        •You’re operating at Kubernetes scale

| **Type**                       | **Description**                                                                                                    | **Use Case**                                                              | **Decision Made By**              | **Tools/Examples**                                            |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Client-side Load Balancer**  | The **calling service (client)** chooses which instance to call using service discovery                            | When you want lightweight in-app balancing without centralized proxy      | **The client itself**             | Netflix Ribbon, Spring Cloud LoadBalancer, gRPC, Feign client |
| **Server-side Load Balancer**  | A **central load balancer** or reverse proxy chooses the backend instance                                          | Entry-point load balancing (e.g., web apps, APIs), centralized control    | **The proxy/load balancer**       | AWS ALB/ELB, NGINX, HAProxy, Kubernetes Service               |
| **Service Mesh Load Balancer** | Each service has a **sidecar proxy** which performs load balancing with advanced features (mTLS, retries, tracing) | Full observability, security, and control over service-to-service traffic | **Sidecar proxies (e.g., Envoy)** | Istio, Linkerd, Consul Connect, Kuma                          |
